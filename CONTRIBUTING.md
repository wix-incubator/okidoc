# Contributing to okidoc

## Tests

To run tests for projects, use `npm run test` from root project.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [conventionalcommits](https://conventionalcommits.org) to format our commit messages. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to generate the [okidoc release notes](https://github.com/wix/okidoc/releases).
